Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-does-someone-that-is-empowered-help-someone-that-is-not-empowered?-Describe-something-you-could-do-at-Del-Norte-HS."> </a></h2><ul>
<li>If someone is more digitally empowered than another. THe obvious step is to share. Sharing resoucres such as wifi or laptops or iphones can help digitally empower another student.</li>
<li>Another way of helping without directly providing something physical is helping/teaching. Doing things like signing up for tutorial or asking questions from more knowledgable peers will help one increare there digital power</li>

<h2 id="Is-paper-or-red-tape-blocking-digital-empowerment?-Are-there-such-barriers-at-Del-Norte?-Elsewhere?">Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Is-paper-or-red-tape-blocking-digital-empowerment?-Are-there-such-barriers-at-Del-Norte?-Elsewhere?"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>Paper and red tape can slow down and stop digital empowerment becuase they make it harder to access information. These older systems take up more time and are less effiecnt as well as less knowledgeable. Digitilizing information makes it more convientint and effecient for others.</li>
<li>Example : Blocks on websites on PUSD Wifi<ul>
<li>some neccesary websites and applications require the bypassing of the school wifi.</li>
</ul>
