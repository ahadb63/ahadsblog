<h1 id="Submission-1">Submission 1<a class="anchor-link" href="#Submission-1"> </a></h1><p>My Score: 1/6</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ahadb63/ahadsblog/issues/11">My Rubric</a></p>
<p>College Board Score: 1/6</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXDauimq8edpT0-aZ2iIujzLdIxtyKMx/view">College Board Rubric</a></p>
<p>Reflection: My scoring and the college board scoring were similar on this submission. I recognized that the submission was missing a lot of components so they werent able to earn full points.</p>

<h1 id="Submission-2">Submission 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Submission-2"> </a></h1><p>My Score: 6/6</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ahadb63/ahadsblog/issues/11">My Rubric</a></p>
<p>College Board Score: 6/6</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXDauimq8edpT0-aZ2iIujzLdIxtyKMx/view">College Board Rubric</a></p>
<p>Reflection: My scoring and the college board scoring were the same. I felt like this submission was checking all the boxes as I was going through the rubric. I can use this as an example and for tips so that I also get full points.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Submission-3">Submission 3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Submission-3"> </a></h1><p>My Score: 6/6</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ahadb63/ahadsblog/issues/11">My Rubric</a></p>
<p>College Board Score: 5/6</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXDauimq8edpT0-aZ2iIujzLdIxtyKMx/view">College Board Rubric</a></p>
<p>Reflection: Again my score and college board's score are very similar this time mine being one points too high. This means that I recognized most of the good work the submission had but I might have went to easy on them and awarded another point</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Submission-4">Submission 4<a class="anchor-link" href="#Submission-4"> </a></h1><p>My Score: 5/6</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ahadb63/ahadsblog/issues/11">My Rubric</a></p>
<p>College Board Score: 3/6</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXDauimq8edpT0-aZ2iIujzLdIxtyKMx/view">College Board Rubric</a></p>
<p>Reflection: This time my score and college boards score were a little off. I may have not analyzed the submissin correctly in accordance to the rubric therefor ending up giving the submission more points than it deserves.</p>

<h3 id="takeaway">takeaway<a class="anchor-link" href="#takeaway"> </a></h3><p>Using both CPT grading 1 and 2, I am able to take away lots of information from the submissions. I now know what to do and what not do. Looking at succesful CPT projects has enabled me to take ideas and implement them into my own project for a full score.</p>
