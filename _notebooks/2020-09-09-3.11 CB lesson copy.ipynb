    "What is Binary Search?\n",
    "- Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. \n",
    "- An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set\n",
    "\n",
    "About Binary Search:\n",
    "- Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated.\n",
    "- In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order\n",
